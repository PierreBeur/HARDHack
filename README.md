## Pitch

Imagine trying to walk without being able to feel your legs.
This is a daily struggle for those with physical disabilities or injuries.
Our project’s goal is to provide a cost-effective tool to assist recovery.

An electromyograph (EMG), is a device which measures the electrical activity of muscles during contraction and relaxation.
Our amplification circuit boosts the faint signals from the EMG,
which is then acquired by an Analog Discovery 2.
Our Python program then relays the signal back to the user as real-time audio,
providing immediate feedback, leading to better outcomes and faster recovery.
